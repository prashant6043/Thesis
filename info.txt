I made use of p5js for the User interface design, this comprises of the canvas, robot image and so on.
I created an html file called index.html where I linked all my stylesheet files and javascript files.
I created multiple javascript files.
agent.js - holds the class that represents the robot
bar.js - contains the class that represents the BAR
entity.js - contains an abstract class that agent and bar inherit from
geneticAlgorithm.js - contains the functions pertaining to the genetic algorithm make up
main.js - this is the main javascript file that executes the game
utils.js - contains helper functions for main.js
neuralNetwork.js - contains the class that builds and simulate the neuralNetwork
vector.js - contains the base class for all vectors such as velocity, acceleration and so on


the first function to execute is the setup() which is where the initial assets of the Ui are embedded
the next function that executes continuously is the draw() this contains the logic that creates bars,
run agents, update the position of agents and bars, checks for collisions and so on

the neural network holds the model that predictions.
the Agent class contains the logic that helps the agent know how to move.
