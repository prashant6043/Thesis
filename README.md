# neuroevolution

My goal is to develop a simulator using a neuroevolution algorithm to 
train and control an artificial creature to perform specific tasks.

• Train artificial creatures to cover the maximum distance by jumping 
and avoiding obstacles (bars of varying heights). 
a. Use a pre-defined image of creatures in evolutionary algorithms.
b. Train the artificial neural network to train the images of creatures. 
• Evaluate and study the maximum fitness score achieved by the 
different creatures.
a. Study the impacts of population size, different mutation rates.
b. Study the performance of when the population is selected based on 
different selection methods.
c. Study the effect of crossover-type with different population size
